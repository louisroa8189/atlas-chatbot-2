Burger Menu
Navigation Links | Gradient Options | Social Media Bar
What is the Burger Menu?
A burger menu is an icon used on a website's header that, when clicked, opens a side menu or navigation drawer. It is represented by three lines that look like the famous sandwich, thus the name "burger." See below example.
Primary Navigation Links
The standard main navigation menu can contain a maximum of 5 links.

However, you can add more links if the Mega Menu is enabled. Please see the Mega Menu page for more details.
You can also choose to have a 'Burger Menu' - this replaces the primary links with three horizontal links which users have to click to see primary navigation links.
It is recommended that instead of secondary navigation, to represent links in the body of your site, either by using buttons, images with overlays that link out, break up content or use partitions with different background colours. Understandably for larger sites with multiple events and locations, this is not ideal and can now be replaced with the Mega Menu function if further links/sublinks are required.
The Navigation menu in the header is created as part of the site template and includes links to a standard set of pages including:
• Home
• Exhibitors
• Seminars
• For Exhibitors
Ordering of Navigation Links
The default order in which the Navigation links appear is driven by the order in which they are listed in the Site Structure, and this is essentially the order in which they were created.

To change the order, load the Site Structure view and then click on the 'Language' page (e.g. 'English') so that the site pages are listed. Click on the icon to the far right (next to the 'Create' button) and select ‘List View’.

This will present all of the pages in a list. To the right of each item is a column of dots; this acts as a handle for the page. Move your cursor over this handle, click and hold and drag the page up or down

Adding & removing links from navigation
By default, any new pages that you create are hidden from the Navigation.

You can add or 'unhide' a page by opening in in ‘Edit’ mode and select 'Open Properties' from the slider control menu in the toolbar at the top of the page. When the configuration window opens uncheck the box next to 'Hide
from Navigation'.
To remove a page from the navigation, open the page in ‘Edit’ mode and the selecting 'Open Properties' from the slider menu in the toolbar at the top of the page. When the configuration window opens tick the box next to ‘Hide from Navigation’.

Click on the tick in the top right of the configuration window and the page will refresh. You will see that the page now appears in the Navigation.
Changes are not appearing on my site
Sometimes changes to the the header navigation do not appear on the live site (or only on certain pages). Try the following:
• Publish the page you made the change on
• Publish the 'live' page
• Publish all other pages
If the changes still haven't appeared on the live site, please raise a support ticket.

The Cookie Banner & Cookie Management (OneTrust)
Overview 
The Cookie Message banner is managed via OneTrust
The Cookie banner messaging is determined by the Privacy Office and is set up according to rules within the OneTrust cookie management tool (https://app.onetrust.com)
The RELX cookie compliance tool (OneTrust) is the mandatory tool that RX deploys across all of its websites.
It is important that we provide: a) the correct notice b) choice and c) consent for any data that’s transferring via the cookie data outside – all of which our tool covers. 
Cookie Management with OneTrust
About OneTrust
OneTrust is a RELX-wide tool that is used for managing cookies compliance on websites. In order to comply with cookie legislation across different territories, OneTrust is used to allow users to accept different types of cookies on a website. As there are different types of legislation across different territories (some require users to explictly accept cookies before using a site, while others do not require this), BUs and the Digital Privacy Office (DPO) manage the geo-location rules and templates within the OneTrust online tool (app.onetrust.com)
How to request access to the OneTrust tool
Request access to the OneTrust tool is via ServiceNow. You will need to specify that you require Cookie Manager access for your BU (ie. for the UK it will be RXUK OneTrust Cookie Manager access, for Australia it is RXAU OneTrust Cookie Manager access).

How to register for the OneTrust help portal
Go to my.onetrust.com and create an account by entering your email address and username. This is required to access help documentation.

RX classifies cookies into four classifications:
1.       Strictly Necessary Cookies (consent not required)

These cookies are essential in order to enable a user to move around the website, perform basic functions, and use its features such as: - requested services (shopping baskets, e-billing etc.) - authentication - website security - network management; or - remembering user preferences (provided they are not linked to a persistent identifier). These cookies may be set automatically when pages load or as a result of a user request that cannot be fulfilled without the use of the cookie. Generally these are session cookies that expire on closing the browser but not always
2.       Performance Cookies

These cookies are used to provide site owners with - statistical information; - performance measurement and improvement information (such as page visits, dwell time, bounce rates, technologies used to access the site, and page load speeds); and - visitor behaviour
3.       Functionality Cookies 

These cookies are there to support site functionality that is visible or advantageous to the user or their experience of the site. This includes personalisation such as user name, language, or the region the user is in, and enhanced functionality like web chat services, surveys, commenting and rating systems, and user preferences.
4.       Targeting Cookies - AKA Advertising or Marketing Cookies
These cookies are used to (amongst other things): - managing the performance of adverts; - displaying adverts; - building user profiles to determine the display of adverts elsewhere (re-targeting); and - provide third party social sharing, content or functionality services. These will almost always be third-party cookies and mostly persistent.

OneTrust Cookie Management Banner on Websites outside Atlas
The OneTrust Cookie Management Banner is required on all RX websites regardless if they are hosted on Atlas or not. Please find details of how to implement the OneTrust banner on websites outside of Atlas.

Using the the OneTrust ID in scripts
The OneTrust script is generic and the basic structure can be used across multiple websites (if you use the OneTrust ID as a variable). To obtain the OneTrust ID do the following:
• Login to OneTrust Tool (https://app.onetrust.com/auth/login)
• Go to ‘Websites’
• Type the name of the domain in the search filter (top left) - ie. atlas-domain.com
• Click on the required domain (ensuring that this is the correct domain and not a similar subdomains such as v2.atlas-domain.com or hub.atlas-domain)
• In the URL, there will be an ID after /scan-results/ and before /reports. Copy and paste this into notepad (ie. for austropharm.at, the URL is https://app.onetrust.com/cookies/scan-results/29743d2f-c144-4ed9-b991-5c138f80e7e0/reports). The domain ID is therefore 29743d2f-c144-4ed9-b991-5c138f80e7e0
When you are using a generic OneTrust script, you have two main options:
• Automated Blocking of Cookies on or off

Favicons & Robots.txt
Overview
Favicons (also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon), is a file containing one or more small icons, associated with a website.
robots.txt files allow websites to communicate with web crawlers and web robots. It is often used to hide pages from search results.
Key Features and Configuration
Create a metadata folder
A metadata folder is required to house these assets so they are integrated with the site as a default.
• Create a top level folder in your Digital Asset Management (DAM) called 'metadata'.
• The metadata folder will house favicon and robots.txt files.
Adding Favicons
• Create a favicon for your site 16x16 pixels.
• You can either use a graphics program such as Photoshop or an online favicon generator.
• Upload the favicon to the 'metadata' folder.
• Publish the file and publish the folder.
Adding robots.txt
• Upload the *robots.txt file to the ‘metadata’ folder.
• Publish the file and then publish the folder

- Noindex: tells search engines not to include your page(s) in search results.
- Disallow: tells them not to crawl your page(s).
- Nofollow: tells them not to follow the links on your page.

• Suggested robots.txt file - this will ensure error pages are not being crawled and indexed by search engines or included in search results. In addition, the exhibitor-portal link will not be included in search results or to follow the exhibitor-portal link.

User-agent: *
Disallow: /*error-pages
Noindex: /*error-pages
